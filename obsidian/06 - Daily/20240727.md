# DAILY NOTE
## Saturday, July 27th, 2024
***
### Journal
This day marks the beginning of my self improvement journey. I have made the becessary preparations to make every single day of the journey efficient. I have also decided that along with self improvement, I will also review ALL the relevant and necessary subjects to become a well rounded computer engineer. I will add more knowledge to my own studies especially the ones not taught by our professors and mentors. Resources will be derives from pdf books, youtube videos, and online documentations/forums.

During this journey, my schedule will be tight especially on weekdays in which there are schedules classes and lectures. To address this dilemma, I will dedicate 2 hours every day to study 2 specific subjects, preferably one study session at morn and one at night. On weekends, however, if there are no scheduled matters to attend to, I will dedicate 4 hours of my time to study (1 subject for each hour) along with rigorous workouts (resistance/body weight during saturdays and cardio on sundays). The remaining hours will be used for leisure and other necessary activities.

I am hoping to improve myself physically, mentally, and intellectually. Hoping for the best. Godspeed.
