# DAILY NOTE
## Wednesday, July 31st, 2024

### Journal
Today I still felt under the weather but managed to accept an offer to fix a computer. I was unable to study because of further distractions. Because of this, I shifted focus on physical exercise. I know it is not fit to exercise when your body is not well but after I worked out, my body felt better and lighter. I could also feel my fatigue lifting.

Tomorrow I will be focusing on finishing my clearance, it would be ideal to finish it on or before Friday. Failure to do so will result in the inability to enroll for this yearâ€™s semester. Though I am considering a break from education, because all of the subjects in the curriculum can be learned online, it is still too risky. A college degree is essential so I will persevere tomorrow and make it so I will be enrolled.

I will make up the following day tomorrow and study at least four of the specific first semester subjects.

I am hoping to improve myself physically, mentally, and intellectually. Hoping for the best. Godspeed.
